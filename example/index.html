        It is becoming the party of mishaps, if not of mean-spiritedness. Ahead of
        an election on May 18th the ruling, right-of-centre Liberal Party has been
        obliged to disavow two of its parliamentary candidates for Islamophobia.
        Another stepped down after it emerged that he had called on the party to
        expel gay members. A fourth candidate was censured, but not dumped, for
        suggesting that women lack the “business skills” to earn as much as men.

      <p>Australia’s main opposition party, Labor, faces similar scandals: it
        ditched two of its would-be mps this month for sexist and anti-Semitic
        slurs. But it does not already have a reputation for prejudice and
        division. Last year the Liberals’ parliamentary caucus toppled its
        moderate leader, Malcolm Turnbull, in a right-wing coup. Female Liberal
        mps have since made headlines by accusing their male colleagues of
        intimidation and misogyny. The new leadership has tried to revive the
        party’s prospects by fanning paranoia about the trickle of illegal
        immigrants who attempt to reach Australia’s northern shores by boat from
        Indonesia and by promising to cut legal immigration, too. It also insists
        that Labor’s plans to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases will wreck the
        economy.</p>
